=== BSNES Mercury Performance Core for RetroArch ===

bsnes-mercury is a fork of higan, aiming to restore some useful features that have been removed, as well as improving performance a bit. Maximum accuracy is still uncompromisable; anything that affects accuracy is optional and off by default.

Module adds support for Super Nintendo

Note: Due to the extreme accuracy, this Core is very slow

Available executables and arguments to run Core:
- /bin/bsnes <rom> <clover_args>
